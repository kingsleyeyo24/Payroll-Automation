# Payroll-Automation

### Please note that this is synthetic data and does not contain any real information about my clients or their company.

#### First, I duplicated the dataset. As data professionals, we often do this to preserve the original copy for reference in case anything goes wrong. Issues rarely occur, but keeping an untouched version is considered best practice.

#### This is the data we got. It’s ugly and messy, so we’re going to fix it.

#### Next, I converted the dataset into a table and applied a purple theme to match the company’s colors. I reformatted columns like **DateOfBirth, HireDate, TerminationDate, and LastPromotion** into proper date types and added placeholders where needed.

#### Still within **General Data**, I changed columns such as **JobLevel, EmploymentType, PayFrequency, BenefitPlan, and IsActive** into dropdown lists for easier data entry and consistency.
